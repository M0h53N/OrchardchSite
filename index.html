                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p>Welcome to Orchard, we've been protecting and caring for our young people since 2017 across the East Midlands. We have been established after Orchard directors were inspired to provide opportunities to children in care.</p>
                    
                    <p>At Orchard we believe that every child and young person deserves to be loved by dedicated, highly skilled adults, who work within safeguarding frameworks and go to great lengths to create a loving and diverse environment for young people.</p>
                    
                    <p>Young people are our upmost priority, and our aim is to ensure that every young person is empowered to develop their social, emotional, independence and functional skills, enabling them to and take steps towards resilience, wellbeing, and educational opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight">Like an Orchard Garden we are devoted to nurture and support young people to flourish to their full potential.</p>
